description: "Governance, control panel, and meta-layer documentation"

This section contains the governance layer for the Library:

- **Rework Control Panel** - non-negotiables, canonical vocabulary, ingestion rules
- **Decision Map** - tracked decisions and open questions  
- **Analysis** - structural audits, build logs, extraction work

The System layer prevents drift and maintains coherence as the Library scales.
